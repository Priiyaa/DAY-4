# Local Hack Day: Build (DAY-4)
Today I made the popular _Caesar Cipher_
<br><br>
_What it does?_
<br>
It encrypts the message by shifting the letters by the number(key) given by the user.
<br><br>
_Technologies used_
<br>
I made it using JS , CSS and HTML5
<br><br>
Check it out in the master branch. I have also published it to gitgub pages.
